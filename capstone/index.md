## Analysis of Planned Baltimore Transit

**Project description:** As an undergraduate at Johns Hopkins University I worked on a capstone project along with fellow students Raphaelle Ortiz and Jefferson Riera. Our hope was to develop connections between the narratives of Baltimore that describe how historical events, policy decisions, and underlying social dynamics have shaped the city along with geospatial data that quantify and illustrate environmental and social issues. We focused on the intersection of transportation and access to healthy food and job opportunities. Our project is based on the premise that transportation networks are designed in such a way that they make resources less accessible for predominantly poor African American communities. 


We used the cost-distance tools in ArcGIS to determine the projected change in transit times between the (then current) bus routes and the (then proposed) "Hogan plan".
